Autotelic Fullstack Developer Test
==================================

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test! It consists of two parts:

* [A coding test](#coding-test)
* [A few technical questions](#technical-questions)

## Coding Test

The task for this test is to create either a web application or a command-line application in Javascript, using any libraries or frameworks you like. The intent of this exercise is to give you a chance to demonstrate your strengths while approaching the problem. To choose an appropriate application type, think about the type of work you would like to do at Autotelic as well as how best you can showcase your development skills.

We generally recommend candidates donâ€™t spend any longer than 4 hours on the exercise - we know your time is valuable as well. However ideally your test submission should meet these minimum requirements:


* The application should connect to the publicly-available [Bored API](http://www.boredapi.com/), which is [documented here](http://www.boredapi.com/documentation)
* The application should satisfy at least one of the user stories below
* Provide clear instructions in a README markdown file on how to build and run the application, and steps for a reviewer to verify the user story or stories you have completed
* Ensure your application builds and runs without errors!
* Approach the project as you would a professional piece of work - assume your future colleagues will be working on it and maintaining it
* Please include some tests
* Submit your test by [forking this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

### User Stories

> As a **user running the application**  
> I can **view the name of an activity**  
> So that **I have something to do if I am bored**

> As a **user running the application**  
> I can **filter the activity displayed by one or more criteria**  
> So that **I can find an activity more suited to my preferences**

> As a **user running the application**  
> I can **choose to see all available information about an activity**  
> So that **I can see whether I would want to do the activity or not**

> As a **user running the application**  
> I can **choose to get another activity related to the currently displayed activity**  
> So that **I can get a different but similar activity**

## Technical questions

Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called `Answers to technical questions.md`.

1. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
2. What's a language feature of node/javascript that you really like? Please highlight in your code where you've used it and why.
3. What previous experience do you have with the libraries or frameworks you chose? Would you chose different libraries or frameworks if you were doing the test again? Why?
4. What do you think you would need to do to make your code production ready?
5. What changes would you want to make to the API to help in completing the user stories?
6. How long did you spend on the test?
