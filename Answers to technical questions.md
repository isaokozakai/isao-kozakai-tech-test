1. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
- I would add more tests, which I could not find the solution in time, and authentication.<br/><br/>
2. What's a language feature of node/javascript that you really like?
- I like the destructuring assignment in JavaScript, which you can find in the line 4 in Result.jsx.<br/><br/>
3. What previous experience do you have with the libraries or frameworks you chose? Would you chose different libraries or frameworks if you were doing the test again? Why?
- I chose jest previously, and I would choose it again because it is so popular and well supported and well documented.<br/><br/>
4. What do you think you would need to do to make your code production ready?
- I would need to complete unit tests and tests for functions on the UI.<br/><br/>
5. What changes would you want to make to the API to help in completing the user stories?
- I would add time it would take to the response.<br/><br/>
6. How long did you spend on the test?
- It took me 6 hours. I tried to implement a test with mocked data fetching with axios, which took me so long, and I could not find the solution in time.
